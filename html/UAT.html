                <h1>Test plan</h1>
                <p>1) The test plan consists in users with no coding experience testing different parts of the developed treasure hunt app.</p>
                <p>2) The aspects tested are the core functionality of the app such as selecting a treasure hunt, starting the treasure hunt, receiving feedback on answered questions, using the advanced functionality such as the camera etc.</p>
                <p>3) The testing will be done at the end stages of the development when the UI is user friendly and close to completion state such that the user understands what they are expected to do.</p>
                <p>4) The results are recorded in a table bellow -> and each test is either passed or failed depending on the expected test case.</p>
                <p>5) In case a bug is identified the developer will note it down and work on fixing it, after the fix the test will be run again.</p>
                <p>6) The bug identified will have to be fixed by the developer that was assigned to code the part of the treasure hunt that has been found to have a bug.</p>
                <p>7) Re-testing will be done in the same manner over and over until, in a perfect scenario all the test cases are passed successfully.</p>
